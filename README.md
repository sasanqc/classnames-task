# Solution for classnames task

classnames is a commonly-used utility in modern front end applications to
conditionally join CSS class names together. If you've written React
applications, you likely have used a similar library.
Implement the classnames function.
Keep in mind that this function must handle de-duplicating classes, which
means that for example, if { foo: true } and { foo: false } are present at the
same time and false appears later in the arguments, nothing should be
added to the output.

```sh
npm install
npm run build
npm run dev
```
